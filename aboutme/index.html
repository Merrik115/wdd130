    <h2>Caleb Francis</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone, </p>
    <p>My name is Caleb Francis and I am majoring in computer science. I haven't fully decided what I want to do with this degree, but I have an uncle who is a computer programmer and he said he would help me get a job there if I wanted one.</p>
    <p>One of the things that I love most about going to school here at BYU-I is how we include the gospel in every class, even if it is not gospel related. I was born into the Church, but didn't really gain my testimony until later. I servered a full-time mission in St.George Utah and came home right as covid hit.</p>
    <p>I am excited to be in this class with all of you and hope we can all learn together!
